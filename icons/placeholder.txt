For a production extension, you would need to create the following icon files:

1. icon16.png - 16x16 pixels
2. icon48.png - 48x48 pixels
3. icon128.png - 128x128 pixels

You can create these icons using any image editing software. For a countdown timer extension, consider using a clock design, hourglass, or similar time-related imagery with a distinctive color scheme that matches your extension's UI.

When ready, replace this placeholder file with the actual icon files and update the manifest.json file accordingly.

Icons should be in PNG format with transparency support.
